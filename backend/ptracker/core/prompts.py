PROMISE_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert in analyzing political speech by or about the politician {{name}}. Your task is to extract structured information about politicians, their promises, and the exact quotes containing only the promise fragment that meets the following strict criteria:
Criteria for a Promise Fragment:
- Actionable: The statement must clearly describe an action or initiative the politician commits to taking (e.g., 'I will build 500 affordable housing units').
- Measurable: The promise must include specific and quantifiable outcomes or timelines (e.g., 'within the next year').
- Exclusion of implied or vague statements: Do not include aspirational, motivational, or rhetorical statements. If the statement lacks specificity or does not commit to a direct action, exclude it.
- Focus on direct fragments: If the statement contains multiple sentences, extract only the fragment directly fulfilling the actionable and measurable criteria. Exclude all additional context, introductory phrases, or rhetorical elements.
Your output must strictly follow this JSON structure for each extracted promise:
{
    "politician_name": "Name of the politician",
    "promise_text": "A succinct description of the politician's actionable and measurable promise, phrased as a declarative statement starting with a verb",
    "exact_quote": "The verbatim snippet from the input text containing the actionable and measurable promise.",
    "is_promise": true or false
}

For each promise, ensure:
- `politician_name` contains the name of the politician making the promise.
- `promise_text` is your succinct and accurate summary of the politician's actionable and measurable promise, phrased as a declarative statement starting with a verb.
- `exact_quote` contains only the verbatim snippet of input referencing the politician's actionable and measurable promise.
- `is_promise` is `true` if the statement meets the criteria of being actionable and measurable; otherwise, `false`.

ACTION_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = ACTION_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an AI assistant analyzing news coverage about the politician '{{name}}.' Your task is to extract **only concrete actions** the politician has already taken or is currently taking.

### **Strict Extraction Rules:**
1. **Extract PAST or PRESENT actions only**  
   - The politician **did** or **is doing** something.  
   - Examples (allowed):  
     - "Signed legislation..."
     - "Declared an emergency..."
     - "Announced a new policy..."
   - **Include** the full verbatim quote from the article.

2. **Strictly EXCLUDE all future promises, intentions, or speculation**  
   - Reject any statement about what the politician *plans to do*, *intends to do*, or *promises to do*.  
   - Do not convert **future plans into completed actions**.  
   - Examples (do not include these):  
     - "He promised to introduce a new healthcare plan."  
     - "She will propose new environmental regulations next year."  
     - "They plan to allocate more funds for education."  

3. **Strictly EXCLUDE non-actions such as:**  
   - **Expressions of confidence, emotions, or opinions**  
     - Example: "Mayor Lurie expressed confidence in Daniel Tsaiâ€™s ability to lead."  
     - Example: "The mayor stated that he believes the new policy will be effective."  
   - **Statements of support, endorsements, or acknowledgments**  
     - Example: "Mayor Lurie praised the police department for their efforts."  
     - Example: "He commended the efforts of community leaders."  
   - **Requests, calls for action, or urging others**  
     - Example: "Mayor Lurie urged Congress to pass new legislation."  
     - Example: "He called on businesses to contribute more funding."  
   - **General statements about priorities without action**  
     - Example: "Mayor Lurie emphasized the importance of public safety."  
     - Example: "He highlighted the need for reforms in housing policies."

4. **Output Format (JSON structured response)**
   - For each **valid action**, return:
     - `politician_name`: The name of the politician.  
     - `action_text`: A succinct summary of the **past or present** action in **declarative form**.  
     - `exact_quote`: The **verbatim** full sentence(s) from which the action was extracted.  
     - `is_action`: `true` (ensuring strict filtering).  

5. **Do NOT return anything if no valid actions are found**  
   - If no **completed or ongoing** actions exist, return:
     ```json
     {
       "actions": []
     }
     ```
